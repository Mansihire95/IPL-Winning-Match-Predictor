ðŸ”® IPL Winning Match Predictor â€“ Streamlit App
This project is a machine learning-based IPL match winner prediction system, developed using Python and deployed with an interactive Streamlit interface. It predicts the winning chances of teams based on real-time match inputs such as:
Batting and bowling teams
Venue
Target score
Current score, overs, and wickets

ðŸ“Š How It Works:

A trained classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) is used to compute the win probability of either team.
Live inputs are taken through a Streamlit-based UI, allowing users to simulate match scenarios.
Outputs are visualized using dynamic graphs and win probability percentages.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Streamlit for UI
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations

âœ… Features:

1) Intuitive, user-friendly interface
2) Real-time prediction with easy input sliders
3)Clean visualization of win probability
